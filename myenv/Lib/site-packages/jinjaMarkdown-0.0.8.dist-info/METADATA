# Jinja2 Markdown Filter

This package offers a markdown filter to can be used to convert markdown to html code within a jinja2 template. 

# How to Use

1. First install the package

        pip install jinjaMarkdown

2. Import and Add the extension to your jinja enviroment (this should be done in app.py for flask)

        #import package
        from jinjaMarkdown.markdownExtension import markdownExtension
        
        #add markdownExtension to enviroment (by default jinja_env)
        app.jinja_env.add_extension(markdownExtension)

3. Use markdown filter as you would any other jinja filter
        
        {{ "# Hello World" | markdown }}

    The above code would be equivalent to
        
        "<p><h1>Hello World</h1></p>"

    If autoescape is on (as it is by default) this will not be rendered as html code and instead as a string.

4. Autoescape can be turned off like so:
        
        {% autoescape false %}
        {{ "# Hello World" | markdown }}
        {% endautoescape %}
      **Note:** Malicious code can be run while autoescape is turned off, so please keep your code secure.
